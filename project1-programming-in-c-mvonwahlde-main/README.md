# How to run
- Makefile: type "make" in terminal to compile code. Then, type "./main" to execute
- Command line: type "gcc -Wall main.c merge.c test.c -o main" to compile. Then, type "./main" to execute

## Cleaning the files
The Makefile is currently set up to work for Linux. If you are running on Windows change "rm" to "del" and "main" to "main.exe" all under the clean line. After, type "make clean" to delete the built files.
